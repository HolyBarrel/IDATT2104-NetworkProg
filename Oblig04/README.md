## Obligatory 04

This is the fourth obligatory exersize in Network Programming

Task: 

1: Create a simple calculator solution where the server/client uses UDP for communication. 
The client sends the numbers to the server and receives the result back. 
The solution can be made similar to the solution created for exercise 3 (socket). *DONE*

2: Run the TLS example from the link provided in the lecture. 
You will now be able to see, using a "sniffer," that the communication is encrypted. *PARTIALLY DONE*
