COMPLETED: 
  Create a library which has a function to multiply two matrices of varying sizes, if the matrices are compatible.
  Create a console app which tests the library function w/out parallelization. 
  
IN-PROGRESS: 
  Create code that tests the function with parallelization on either CPU or GPU.
  Show how large the matrices would need to be such that parallelization is superior in terms of time in relation to the serial solution.
