## Obligatory task 5
This is the fifth obligatory task: 
  - Create a website that allows you to input and run source code. 
  - Use Docker to safely compile and run the source code on the server-side. 
  - Any programming language can be used, including JavaScript and Python. This applies to both the implementation of the web application and the programming language that will be compiled and executed within the web application.

To solve this, I first created a MVP with the minimum functionality to meet the basic requirements.
Then the plan is to expand on this with:
  - Several possibilities for languages to compile.
  - Implementation of dockerode https://github.com/apocas/dockerode
